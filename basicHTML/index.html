        <i>Grimms' Fairy Tales</i>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id="p0">The
        <strong>Grimms' Fairy Tales</strong>, originally known as the Children's and Household Tales
        <em>(German: Kinder- und Hausmärchen)</em>, is a collection of fairy tales by the Grimm brothers or "Brothers Grimm",
        Jacob and Wilhelm, first published on 20 December 1812. The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh
        edition in 1857, had 211 unique fairy tales.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p id="p1">Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of nine children from their mother Dorothea (Née Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm
        Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to
        school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working
        pupils throughout their education. They followed their father’s footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law.
        However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because
        the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann
        Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing
        their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school,
        Lyzeum, in Kassel. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they
        needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.</p>
    <p id="p2">
        Shortly after attending Lyzeum, their beloved grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family
        in the future. The two became hell-bent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to
        their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared
        the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802.
        Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of
        his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the University of Marburg. They particularly
        needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance.
        University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities than
        schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did
        not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions
        away.</p>
    <p id="p3">Jacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. When Wilhelm joined
        Jacob at the university, Jacob attained a reputation about him and drew the attention of Professor Friedrich Carl
        von Savigny.</p>
    <h3>Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny</strong> was the founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal
        and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close
        with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and
        folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was
        gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel
        in 1806, he decided to quit studying law and instead spent his full efforts on German literature. While Jacob studied
        literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm received his degree in law at Marburg.</p>
